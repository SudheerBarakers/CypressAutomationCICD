## Overview

This project is designed to create a robust, scalable, and efficient automated testing framework for web applications using Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing tool. 
The framework leverages JavaScript for scripting test cases, integrates with GitHub for version control, employs Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), 
and utilizes Docker for containerized testing environments.

## Tech Stack

# Cypress:

Purpose: End-to-end testing framework.
Features: Fast, reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser. Cypress allows you to write tests in JavaScript, making it easy to create, run, and debug test cases.

# JavaScript:

Purpose: Scripting language for writing test cases.
Features: Widely used language with a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools. JavaScript is used to interact with the Cypress API and to write test logic.

# GitHub:

Purpose: Version control and collaboration.
Features: Hosting platform for version control using Git. Provides a web-based interface for managing repositories, collaborating on code, and integrating with other tools.

# Jenkins:

Purpose: Continuous integration and continuous deployment.
Features: Open-source automation server. Jenkins is used to automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring that code changes are automatically tested and deployed.

# Docker:

Purpose: Containerization of the testing environment.
Features: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Docker ensures that the testing environment is consistent across different machines and stages of development.
