#Overview
This project is designed to create a robust, scalable, and efficient automated testing framework for web applications using Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing tool. The framework leverages JavaScript for scripting test cases, integrates with GitHub for version control, employs Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and utilizes Docker for containerized testing environments.
